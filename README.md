music recommendation system for mothers with postpartum depression or who are at risk of suffering from postpartum depression and whether the method used can provide accurate recommendations. The method used is Convolutional Recurrent Neural 
Network or CRNN. The results obtained from experiments using CNN and CRNN methods in developing a music recommendation system are quite good results in detecting music tempo for both methods.
